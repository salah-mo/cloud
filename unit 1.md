## on-premises data center vs. cloud

- on-premises data center: you buy hardware and install it on your
  premises. You are responsible for the hardware, software, and the network that connects them.
- cloud: you rent hardware and software from a cloud provider. You are
  responsible for the network that connects to the cloud provider.

## AWS Cloud

- AWS Cloud: a collection of remote servers hosted on the Internet, to
  which you can connect to store and access data, run applications, and
  manage IT resources.
